                    Humans Marketplace uses Keplr, an open-source browser
                    extension wallet for the Cosmos interchain ecosystem. <br />
                    All Keplr transactions are signed offline on your device,
                    meaning that all your private keys are encrypted and
                    securely stored on your computer. <br />
                    To set up your Keplr wallet: <br />- Download the addon from
                    the browser&apos;s application store <br />
                    - Install the Keplr extension <br />- Click on the installed
                    Keplr extension that will prompt the following page in your
                    browser:
                </p>

                <p className="pt--10">
                    - Either Create a new account or Import an existing account
                    with the mnemonic phrase you got from the previous step of
                    creating an account.
                    <br /> <br />
                    NOTE: The wallet is currently not fully connected to the
                    Humans Marketplace network, so you’ll have to follow the
                    extra step below.
                </p>
                <h4>Link Keplr to the Humans network</h4>
                <p className="pt--10">
                    - Open the Humans Marketplace <br /> - Click on “Wallet” or
                    click the Get Started button
                </p>
                <img src="/images/tutorials/2.png" alt="2" />
                <p className="pt--10">
                    - Click on the “Keplr Wallet” button at the top of the
                    screen (used for login):
                </p>
                <img src="/images/tutorials/3.png" alt="3" />
                <p className="pt--10">- Input your password:</p>

                <p className="pt--10">
                    - A pop-out window will ask you for permission to add a new
                    network to Keplr and also give access – it will look like
                    this:
                </p>
                <img src="/images/tutorials/5.png" alt="5" />
                <p className="pt--10">
                    - After you approve both screens, you need to open the
                    extension and click on the network name at the top (the
                    default is Cosmos Hub). From there, a menu with all the
                    networks will open, scroll down and select Humans Network.{" "}
                    <br />
                    After that, Keplr will visualize the correct information
                    about your account. The address displayed will be your
                    Humans native wallet address.
                </p>
                <img src="/images/tutorials/6.png" alt="6" />
                <p className="pt--10">
                    - Once you have set up and linked your Keplr wallet to the
                    Humans network, you can now perform token interactions on
                    the Humans network, including staking to earn rewards and
                    getting involved in shaping our network’s future by
                    participating in network governance, voting on active
                    proposals and deploying smart contracts.
